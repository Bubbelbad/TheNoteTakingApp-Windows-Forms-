5,Carl,Pale Blue Dot,Poem,True,Before we invented civilization our ancestors lived mainly in the open out under the sky. #Before we devised artificial lights and atmospheric pollution and modern forms of nocturnal entertainment we watched the stars.##There were practical calendar reasons of course but there was more to it than that. Even today the most jaded city dweller can be unexpectedly moved upon encountering a clear night sky studded with thousands of twinkling stars. ##When it happens to me after all these years it still takes my breath away.
