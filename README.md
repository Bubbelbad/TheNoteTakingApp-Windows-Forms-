# TheNoteTakingApp (Windows Forms)
I decided to make a classic note taking app in winforms for this assignment. I need to practice file-handling and saving things locally. 
It should be a very simple design that allows you to create messages and save author, title, category and if it's a secret. 
Some of the messages will be pre-written examples (for first time use) and some will be created and then saved for use another day.

## criteria:
- A program that saves a file locally and then uploads them again.
- There should be at least two panels or windows, that sends information between each other.
- There needs to be a list of objects that you can add to and remove from.
- These objects should be saved as CSV, and then again uploaded and used in the program.

## what I want to add:
- Possibility to save the collection of notes as CSV, Text and Json.
- To be able to change theme (at least the background hey)
- To use both panels and pop-up windows.
- Being able to open different files from an explorer to use and edit in the program - CSV only, because sin of sloth ;)
