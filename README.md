# Note Taking App (Windows Forms)

This is a school assignment for my course 'object oriented programming I' in Windows Forms. I chose this project because I wanted to practice file-handling and saving things localy. 

It should be a very simple design that allows you to create messages and save author, title, category and if it's a secret.


## Features

- Possibilities to save current file/collection as csv, txt and json
- New color theme and tool bar
- Using panels and pop-up windows
- toolStripMenu and toolStripStatus


## Lessons Learned

In this project I learned about file handling and how to get around saving text with commas and line change as CSV. I am glad I used the Json function, as I initially thought that would be harder than it was.

The graphic design was fun but it was hard to get the tool bar exactly how I wanted.I used the MaterialSkin 2.3.1 which added a lot of code that I didnt have that much control over.
