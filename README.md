# TheNoteTakingApp (Windows Forms)
This is a school assignment in Windows Forms. I needed to practice file-handling and saving things localy. 
It should be a very simple design that allows you to create messages and save author, title, category and if it's a secret. 
All the notes are saved locally as CSV automaticly.

## the criteria I had to fulfill:
- A program that saves a file locally and then uploads them again
- There should be at least two panels or windows, that sends information between each other
- There needs to be a list of objects that you can add to and remove from
- These objects should be saved as CSV, and then again uploaded and used in the program

## what I wanted to further add:
- Possibility to save the current file/collection of notes as Text and Json
- Being able to choose location where to save the .txt and .json files
- Adding a new color theme rather than having the default colors
- To use both panels and pop-up windows
- Using toolStripMenu and toolStripStatus just because it's nice
